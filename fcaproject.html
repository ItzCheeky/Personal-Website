                    In my role as an Engineering Maintenance Supervisor at the Stellantis FCA Toledo Machining Plant in Perrysburg, Ohio, I successfully managed
                    a team of seven skilled tradesmen responsible for promptly addressing and repairing stamping presses as needed.

                <p class="aboutDescriptionText">
                    One of my notable achievements included leading a dedicated team in a Kaizen project aimed at overhauling and optimizing all diagrams related to the 377 DIE,
                    resulting in significant improvements in repair times. This initiative was so impactful that it garnered recognition from the Plant Manager,
                    who awarded it as the best intern project of the summer.

                <p class="aboutDescriptionText">
                    Additionally, I took charge of daily meetings to coordinate plans and ensure adherence to COVID-19 safety regulations. My key strengths in
                    this role were my meticulous attention to detail and adept multitasking abilities, contributing to the overall success of the projects and
                    the operational efficiency of the plant. 
                </p>
                <p class="aboutDescriptionText">
                    Furthermore, while this role was not directly related to programming, it provided me with invaluable experience in leading a team and 
                    enhancing my leadership skills. The ability to coordinate and inspire a team of skilled professionals, facilitate daily meetings, and ensure 
                    adherence to strict safety regulations demonstrated my capacity to excel in a leadership capacity. My meticulous attention to detail and 
                    adept multitasking abilities further contributed to the overall success of the projects and the operational efficiency of the plant.
                </p>
                <p class="aboutDescriptionText">
                    These experiences, although not programming-specific, have been instrumental in shaping my leadership abilities and problem-solving skills that 
                    are transferrable to various professional settings."</p>
